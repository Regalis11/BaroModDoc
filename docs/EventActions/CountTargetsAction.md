| CompareToTarget               | Identifier | ""            | Tag of some other entities to compare the number of targets to. E.g. you could compare the number of entities tagged as "discoveredhull" to entities tagged as "anyhull". The minimum/maximum amount of entities there must be relative to the other entities is configured using MinPercentageRelativeToTarget and MaxPercentageRelativeToTarget. |
| MinPercentageRelativeToTarget | float      | -1.0          | Minimum amount of targets, as a percentage of the number of entities tagged with CompareToTarget. E.g. you could compare the number of entities tagged as "discoveredhull" to entities tagged as "anyhull" to require 50% of hulls to be discovered.                                                                                               |
| MaxPercentageRelativeToTarget | float      | -1.0          | Maximum amount of targets, as a percentage of the number of entities tagged with CompareToTarget. E.g. you could compare the number of entities tagged as "floodedhull" to entities tagged as "anyhull" to require less than 50% of hulls to be flooded.                                                                                           |
