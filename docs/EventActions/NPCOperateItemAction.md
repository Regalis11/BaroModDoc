| NPCTag            | Identifier | ""                   | Tag of the NPC(s) that should operate the item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| TargetTag         | Identifier | ""                   | Tag of the item to operate. If it's not something AI characters can or know how to operate, such as a cabinet or an engine, the NPC will just select it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ItemComponentName | Identifier | "Controller"         | Name of the component to operate. For example, the Controller component of a periscope or the Reactor component of a nuclear reactor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| OrderOption       | Identifier | ""                   | Identifier of the option, if there are several ways the item can be operated. For example, "powerup" or "shutdown" when operating a reactor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| RequireEquip      | bool       | false                | Should the character equip the item before attempting to operate it (only valid if the item is equippable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Operate           | bool       | true                 | Should the character start or stop operating the item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| MaxTargets        | int        | -1                   | Maximum number of NPCs the action can target. For example, you could only make a specific number of security officers man a periscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Priority          | float      | MaxObjectivePriority | AI priority for the action. Uses 100 by default, which is the absolute maximum for any objectives, meaning nothing can be prioritized over it, including the emergency objectives, such as find safety and combat.Setting the priority to 70 would function like a regular order, but with the highest priority.A priority of 60 would make the objective work like a lowest priority order.So, if we'll want the character to operate the item, but still be able to find safety, defend themselves when attacked, or flee from dangers,it's better to use e.g. 70 instead of 100. |
| AbandonOnReset    | bool       | true                 | The event actions reset when a GoTo action makes the event jump to a different point. Should the NPC stop operating the item when the event resets?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
