| Text                    | string      | ""            | The text to display in the prompt. Can be the text as-is, or a tag referring to a line in a text file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| SpeakerTag              | Identifier  | ""            | Tag of the character who's speaking. Makes a speech bubble icon appear above the character to indicate you can speak with them, and stops the character in place when the conversation triggers. Also allows the conversation to be interrupted if the speaker dies or becomes incapacitated mid-conversation.                                                                                                          |
| TargetTag               | Identifier  | ""            | Tag of the player the conversation is shown to. If empty, the conversation is shown to everyone. If SpeakerTag is defined, the conversation is always only shown to the player who interacts with the speaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| WaitForInteraction      | bool        | true          | Should someone interact with the speaker for the conversation to trigger?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| InvokerTag              | Identifier  | ""            | Tag to assign to whoever invokes the conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| FadeToBlack             | bool        | false         | Should the screen fade to black when the conversation is active?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| EndEventIfInterrupted   | bool        | true          | Should the event end if the conversations is interrupted (e.g. if the speaker dies or falls unconscious mid-conversation). Defaults to true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| EventSprite             | string      | ""            | Identifier of an event sprite to display in the corner of the conversation prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| DialogType              | DialogTypes | Regular       | Type of the dialog prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ContinueConversation    | bool        | false         | Does this conversation continue after this ConversationAction? If you have multiple successive ConversationActions, perhaps with some actions happening in between, you can enable this to prevent the dialog prompt from closing between the actions. Not necessary if the ConversationActions are nested inside each other: those are always considered parts of the same conversation, and shown in the same prompt. |
| ContinueAutomatically   | bool        | false         | If enabled, the event will not stop to wait for the conversation to be dismissed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| IgnoreInterruptDistance | bool        | false         | If SpeakerTag is defined, the conversation is interrupted by default if the speaker and the target end up too far from each other. This can be used to disable that behavior, keeping the dialog prompt open regardless of the distance.                                                                                                                                                                                |
