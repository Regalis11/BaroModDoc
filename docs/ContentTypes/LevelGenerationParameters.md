Can be useful for e.g. levels that are just supposed to consist of a pre-built outpost.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Sites determine shape of the voronoi graph which the level walls are generated from. (Decreasing this value causes the number of sites, and the complexity of the level, to increase exponentially - be careful when adjusting)                                                             |

Small values produce roughly rectangular level walls. The larger the values are, the less uniform the shapes get.                                                                                                                                      |

Can be used in conjunction with the rounding values to make the cells rounder. Smaller values will make the cells look smoother, but make the level more performance-intensive as the number of polygons used in rendering and physics calculations increases. |
| CellRoundingAmount                  | float               | 0.5                | How much the individual wall cells are rounded.

Note that the final shape of the cells is also affected by the CellSubdivisionLength parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                |
