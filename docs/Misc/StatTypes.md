# StatTypes


## StatTypes
StatTypes are used to alter several traits of a character. They are mostly used by talents.
A lot of StatTypes use a "percentage" value. The way this works is that the value is 0 by default and 1 is added to the value of the stat type to get the final multiplier.
For example if the value is set to 0.2 then 1 is added to it making it 1.2 and that is used as a multiplier.
This makes it so values between \-100% and +100% can be easily represented as \-1 and 1 respectively. For example 0.5 would translate to 1.5 for +50% and \-0.2 would translate to 0.8 for \-20% multiplier.
