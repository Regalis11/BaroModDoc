| Attribute              | Type    | Default value     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Range                  | float   | 100               | The range of the emitted light. Higher values are more performance-intensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CastShadows            | bool    | true              | Should structures cast shadows when light from this light source hits them. Disabling shadows increases the performance of the game, and is recommended for lights with a short range. Lights that are set to be drawn behind subs don't cast shadows, regardless of this setting. |
| DrawBehindSubs         | bool    | false             | Lights drawn behind submarines don't cast any shadows and are much faster to draw than shadow-casting lights. It's recommended to enable this on decorative lights outside the submarine's hull.                                                                                   |
| IsOn                   | bool    | false             | Is the light currently on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Flicker                | float   | 0                 | How heavily the light flickers. 0 = no flickering, 1 = the light will alternate between completely dark and full brightness.                                                                                                                                                       |
| FlickerSpeed           | float   | 1                 | How fast the light flickers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PulseFrequency         | float   | 0                 | How rapidly the light pulsates (in Hz). 0 = no blinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| PulseAmount            | float   | 0                 | How much light pulsates (in Hz). 0 = not at all, 1 = alternates between full brightness and off.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| BlinkFrequency         | float   | 0                 | How rapidly the light blinks on and off (in Hz). 0 = no blinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| LightColor             | Color   | "255,255,255,255" | The color of the emitted light (R,G,B,A).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| IgnoreContinuousToggle | bool    | false             | If enabled, the component will ignore continuous signals received in the toggle input (i.e. a continuous signal will only toggle it once).                                                                                                                                         |
| AlphaBlend             | bool    | true              | Should the light sprite be drawn on the item using alpha blending, in addition to being rendered in the light map?
