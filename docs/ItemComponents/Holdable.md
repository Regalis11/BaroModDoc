| AttachedByDefault               | bool    | false         | Should the item be attached to a wall by default when it's placed in the submarine editor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| HoldPos                         | Vector2 | "0.0,0.0"     | The position the character holds the item at (in pixels, as an offset from the character's shoulder). For example, a value of 10,-100 would make the character hold the item 100 pixels below the shoulder and 10 pixels forwards.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| AimPos                          | Vector2 | "0.0,0.0"     | The position the character holds the item at when aiming (in pixels, as an offset from the character's shoulder). Works similarly as HoldPos, except that the position is rotated according to the direction the player is aiming at. For example, a value of 10,-100 would make the character hold the item 100 pixels below the shoulder and 10 pixels forwards when aiming directly to the right. |
